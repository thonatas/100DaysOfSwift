# How it works
Welcome to the 100 Days of Swift! This is a free collection of videos, tutorials, tests, and more, all drawn from around my existing work here on Hacking with Swift, and all designed to help you learn Swift.

It’s aimed squarely at beginners who want to learn to build real iOS apps, but struggle to find a good, free course that can help them achieve their goals. If that’s you, welcome – I hope you’re ready to show the iOS world what you’re made of!
 

# Rules
If you want to make a success of this course, there are only two rules:

Every day you spend one hour reading or watching Swift tutorials, or writing Swift code.
Every day you post about your progress to the social media site of your choosing. Tell people!
I’ll be providing all the material you need to follow along, so all you need to do is show up ready to learn.

 

# Tips
I’ve met so many who have tried and failed to learn Swift, often multiple times, and if you’re here there’s a good chance you’ve already had a few false starts already.

Not this time. This time you’re going to learn it for real, and in just 100 days you’ll have built several full apps that you can be proud of.
